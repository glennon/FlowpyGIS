Thanks for your desire to contribute to this code. This is simple code, and I do not expect it will get much more complicated in the near future. If you have a big feature you want to add, submit an issue and discuss. If you have small contributions, just go for it and using the normal GitHub Flow process: fork, make a branch, make your changes, and then do a pull request. Thanks again!
